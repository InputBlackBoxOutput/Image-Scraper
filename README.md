- A file containing a list of keywords can be passed to the program when multiple keywords need to be scraped
- Images from a custom URL can be scraped
- A new directory is created for every keyword
- A prefix and/or a suffix can be added to all the keywords passed to the program via a file
- Duplicate images are found by comparison of SHA-256 hash and then removed
- Similar images are found using perceptual hashing and then removed
